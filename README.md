# Description

this is a bare-bones clone of the ever popular reddit, which is a popular social media.
with features such as comments (without replies) on posts, upvoting and downvoting posts, 
creating subreddits, etc.

# Development Plan

I intend to continue developing this project, and I have a few features in mind to implement

## Features To Implement

<ul>
    <li>nested comments: comments replying to comments replying to comments, this is a very core part of
        what makes reddit so successful and I would love to implement it
    </li>
    <li>joining subreddits: Joining subreddits and restricting posting to only subreddit members is something
        that I definitely want to and should implement so that I can further polish this project
    </li>
    <li>user profiles: in reddit, you can view the profile of someone and see their recent posts and upvotes, 
    I would like to implement this feature as well.
</li>
    <li>modular design: I would like to make the website viewable on all devices and have a responsive design</li>
</ul>
